                      <p>Hamburgers and cheeseburgers are synonymous with American cuisine.</p>
                      <p>A meat patty between a soft hamburger bun with cheese, onions, pickles, and tomatoes is sure to make any mouth water.</p>
                      <p>Hamburgers satisfy the umami and salty flavor cravings on the human tongue and have a high glutamate content, which  fulfills the requirements for a savory dish.</p>
                      <p>If you want to make a healthier hamburger, you can opt for a veggie or chicken burger on a whole grain bun instead.</p>

                      <p>Pizza originated in Italy made of the finest ingredients with fresh cheese, basil, and tomato with not a lot of extra additives.</p>
                      <p>However, since pizza has become big in the United States, it has become way more savory than its Italian predecessor.<p>
                      <p>Now, pizza often has a lot of extra salt and pepper.</p>
                      <p>It is popular to put garlic salt and chili oil on pizza to give it some added spice.</p>
                      <p>Many people choose to add savory toppings such as anchovies or pepperoni to their already-savory pizza.</p>

                      <p>Popcorn is one of the most popular options for savory snackers.</p>
                      <p>Popcorn is also a healthy snack alternative unless you are going for movie theater popcorn butter that is loaded with  saturated fats.</p>
                      <p>If you want to go for a healthier popcorn option, you should choose air-popped popcorn that does not have the extra fat and  calories you might find in prepackaged popcorn.</p>
                      <p>Homemade popcorn also gives you the option to create your own flavor profile.</p>
                      <p>You can add sea salt and olive oil to give it that extra savory flavor without adding any unhealthiness.</p>
                      <p>You can pop your own popcorn on the stove, in the microwave, or an air-popper if you have one.</p>

                      <p>Pretzels are one of the most common foods associated with the savory flavor profile because one of their principal ingredients is salt.</p>
                      <p>They are also quite addictive if you are not careful.</p>
                      <p>If you are trying to watch your health, you can try to go for mini pretzels that keep your snacking at a slower pace,  which allows you to fill up without going overboard.</p>
                      <p>Pretzels are great by themselves but are also amazing vehicles for your favorite dips like guacamole and hummus.</p>

                      <p>Chili is typically made of beans, tomatoes, ground meat, cheese, and other vegetables like celery that add more flavor.</p>           
                      <p>Chili uses umami and salty flavors to create a unique savory flavor profile.</p>
